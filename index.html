        <p>
            Graduated in Electronic Engineering from the Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca.
            Currently pursuing a master's degree in instrumentation and photonics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
            I was born and live in Rio de Janeiro, I'm a big football fan (the real one, not handegg), a supporter
            by CR Vasco da Gama. I'm very interested in manga/anime and drawing, music and good food. Studying the Web
            development to broaden my professional perspectives.

            <p>
                Internship carried out at the Photonics Laboratory (LAFOT) 
                of the Federal Center for Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca. 
                The activities developed were: Control and updating of laboratory cash; Production 
                and testing of electronic circuits; Manufacturing and testing of optical sensors; 
                Assistance and support with measurements on the optical bench.

                Monitoring system and prototype equipment to predict the occurrence of failures in 
                electric induction motors, pump drivers and compressors.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Description: Propose the use of a monitoring system capable of detecting abnormal operating 
                conditions and predicting the occurrence of rotor failures in electric motors that drive 
                ecompressor pumps with the use of magnetostrictive sensors 
                (which deform with changes in their magnetization) and optical fiber inside the 
                monitored engine, therefore invasive, and in the mathematical processing of the 
                measured signals. It has advantages over the current signature technique, due to 
                the latter having overlapping interpretations, failing in large motors due to low 
                slip and being ineffective at low load. The magnetostrictive sensor on optical fibers 
                has an extremely small size and the ability to accurately discriminate the defect in analysis 
                where the current signature technique is ineffective, due to measuring variations in magnetic 
                flux directly in the air gap, where the conversion of electromagnetic energy into mechanical 
                energy occurs. . The effectiveness of the sensor was proven in tests carried out on real engines 
                and compared with the resulting signature, however, the need for improvements was identified to 
                enable use in an industrial environment, which will be implemented within the scope of this project. 
                Application in engines does not require structural modifications and as optical fibers are chemically 
                inert and do not conduct dangerous energy, they can be applied in explosive atmospheres and aggressive 
                environments. The system is expected to process the signals obtained and be capable of extracting 
                diagnoses of the failures that the system predicts. These failure classifications must be integrated 
                into the database of companies in the Oil and Natural Gas sector that will use the system.

                Portable system for detecting Sars-Cov-2
            </h3>
            <p>
                Description: The objective of the proposed project aims to 
                obtain a portable and rapid response system for detecting 
                Sars-CoV-2 infection, which can be used by healthcare professionals 
                without the need for infrastructure and specialized technicians.
